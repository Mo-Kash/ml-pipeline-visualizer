Main project outcome:
    - Help design an ML pipeline via drag-and-drop 
    - Validate the pipeline according to the standard structure: 
        1. Data processing (Data ingestion (csv/json/sql/api/webscraping), Data preprocessing, 
            Data exploration (eda by univariate/bivariate/multivariate analysis or simply pandas profiling), Feature engineering, Data splitting)
        2. Model development (Model selection (linear regression and logistic regression, random forests and decision trees, neural networks), 
            Hyperparameter tuning, Model training (supervised/unsupervised/semisupervised/self supervised/reinforcement/continual) , Model evaluation)
        3. Model deployment (Model serialization, Integration, Architecture, Monitoring, Updates, Compliance)
        [PS: Some of these are obviously optional, so take into consideration when validating]
    - Validation for how well each decision works with another (Eg: certain types of data work well with regression but not so well with decision trees).
        Provide suggestions as the user is building their pipeline and warn them when something may not work well together. 
    - Provide copyable code snippets for each part of each phase. These can be pre-written segments of code which the user can customize.
    - Allow user to export their pipeline diagram as an image.
    - ***[maybe later] Generate a custom jupyter notebook based on the pipeline created 

Other Features:
    - Allow the user to select draggable/droppable elements from a sidebar menu 
        ~ Will have pre-determined elements [commonly/popularly used models, ingestion methods, training methods, etc.]
        ~ Will allow the user to create their own elements
        ~ Each stage  of the pipeline will be represented with different shapes/colours
    - Linient validation. If the way in which the user connects their pipeline doesn't make sense according to my ruleset, display a warning.
        However, if the user is experienced, they may know what they are doing. Thus, let them.
    - Validation implemented by showing error/warning pop-ups telling the user what exactly will not work if they connect in a certain way.
    - Provide options for deployment with links
    - ***[maybe later] Chatbot where they can import their pipeline and ask queries.

The project's task (for now) is simply to help generate a graph-like pipeline diagram for the user's convenience. This is a visualization/planning tool, not an agentic 
SaaS that will give the user a finished product.
